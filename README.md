# Numerical optimization class

- Omar Trejo
- January, 2015

This code was developed for the Numerical Optimization class that I attended at
ITAM during 2015. The class was imparted by Dr. Zeferino Parada. The main topic
is constrained numerical optimization.

The main resource for the class was:

- [Nocedal & Wright - Numerical Optimization (2006)](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387303031)
